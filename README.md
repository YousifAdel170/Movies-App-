## Getting Started

To get started with MovieSphere, follow the steps below to clone and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js

#### Clone the repository

- git clone https://github.com/YousifAdel170/moviesphere.git
- cd moviesphere

#### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

#### Set up the TMDb API key

To fetch movie data from TMDb, you'll need to sign up on TMDb and generate an API key.

1. Go to TMDb API and sign up if you don't have an account.
2. Generate an API key
3. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following line:
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

### Run the app

Now that everything is set up, start the development server:

- npm start
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Movie Data**: The app fetches movie data using the TMDb API based on the selected language and page number.
2. **Pagination**: The app handles pagination, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of movie results.
3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific movies by title, and the app fetches and displays the results accordingly.
4. **Language Toggle**: The app supports toggling between Arabic and English, updating both the UI and the content based on the selected language.
5. **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes for a customized viewing experience. This can be achieved using a button that toggles a dark-mode class or a React context to manage the theme state.
6. **Responsive Design**: The app is built to be fully responsive, making it easy to use on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
